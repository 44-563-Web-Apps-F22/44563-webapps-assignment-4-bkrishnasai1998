    <h3>THE MIKADO Act-II</h3>
    <h5>
        Yum-Yum discovered seated at her bridal toilet, surrounded by
        maidens, who are dressing her hair and painting her face and
        lips, as she judges of the effect in a mirror.<br>
        YUM.  Yes, I am indeed beautiful!  Sometimes I sit and
        wonder, in my artless Japanese way, why it is that I am so much
        more attractive than anybody else in the whole world.  Can this
        be vanity?  No!  Nature is lovely and rejoices in her loveliness.
        I am a child of Nature, and take after my mother.
    </h5>
    <p>
        YUM.  Yes, everything seems to smile upon me.  I am to be
        married to-day to the man I love best and I believe I am the very
        happiest girl in Japan!<br>
        PEEP.  The happiest girl indeed, for she is indeed to be
        envied who has attained happiness in all but perfection.
        YUM.  In "all but" perfection?<br>
        PEEP.  Well, dear, it can't be denied that the fact that
        your husband is to be beheaded in a month is, in its way, a
        drawback.  It does seem to take the top off it, you know.<br>
        PITTI.  I don't know about that.  It all depends!
        PEEP.  At all events, he will find it a drawback.<br>
        PITTI.  Not necessarily.  Bless you, it all depends!<br>
        YUM.  (in tears).  I think it very indelicate of you to
        refer to such a subject on such a day.  If my married happiness
        is to be—to be—<br>
        PEEP.  Cut short.<br>
        YUM.  Well, cut short—in a month, can't you let me forget
        it?  (Weeping.)<br>
        NANK.  Yum-Yum in tears—and on her wedding morn!
        YUM.  (sobbing).  They've been reminding me that in a month
        you're to be beheaded!  (Bursts into tears.)<br>
        PITTI.  Yes, we've been reminding her that you're to be
        beheaded.  (Bursts into tears.)<br>
        PEEP.  It's quite true, you know, you are to be beheaded!
        (Bursts into tears.)<br>
        NANK.  (aside).  Humph!  Now, some bridegrooms would be
        depressed by this sort of thing!  (Aloud.)  A month?  Well,
        what's a month?  Bah!  These divisions of time are purely
        arbitrary.  Who says twenty-four hours make a day?
        PITTI.  There's a popular impression to that effect.<br>
        NANK.  Then we'll efface it.  We'll call each second a
        minute—each minute an hour—each hour a day—and each day a
        year.  At that rate we've about thirty years of married happiness
        before us!<br>
        PEEP.  And, at that rate, this interview has already lasted
        four hours and three-quarters!<br>
        YUM.  (still sobbing).  Yes.  How time flies when one is
        thoroughly enjoying oneself!<br>
        NANK.  That's the way to look at it!  Don't let's be
        downhearted!  There's a silver lining to every cloud.<br>
        YUM.  Certainly.  Let's—let's be perfectly happy!  (Almost
        in tears.)
        GO-TO.  By all means.  Let's—let's thoroughly enjoy
        ourselves.<br>
        PITTI.  It's—it's absurd to cry!  (Trying to force a
        laugh.)<br>
        YUM.  Quite ridiculous!  (Trying to laugh.)
