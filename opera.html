        Yum-Yum discovered seated at her bridal toilet, surrounded by
        maidens, who are dressing her hair and painting her face and
        lips, as she judges of the effect in a mirror.<br>
        YUM.  Yes, I am indeed beautiful!  Sometimes I sit and
        wonder, in my artless Japanese way, why it is that I am so much
        more attractive than anybody else in the whole world.  Can this
        be vanity?  No!  Nature is lovely and rejoices in her loveliness.
        I am a child of Nature, and take after my mother.

    <h5>SONG—YUM-YUM.</h5>
    <p>
             The sun, whose rays
             Are all ablaze
                  With ever-living glory,
             Does not deny
             His majesty—
                  He scorns to tell a story!
             He don't exclaim,
                  "I blush for shame,
                  So kindly be indulgent."
             But, fierce and bold,
             In fiery gold,
                  He glories effulgent!

              I mean to rule the earth,
                   As he the sky—
              We really know our worth,
                   The sun and I!

    RECITATIVE.

        <h5>YUM.</h5>
        <p>Yes, everything seems to smile upon me.  I am to be
        married to-day to the man I love best and I believe I am the very
        happiest girl in Japan!</p>
        <h5>PEEP.</h5>  
        <p>The happiest girl indeed, for she is indeed to be
        envied who has attained happiness in all but perfection.
        YUM.  In "all but" perfection?</p>
        <h5>PEEP.</h5>  
        <p>Well, dear, it can't be denied that the fact that
        your husband is to be beheaded in a month is, in its way, a
        drawback.  It does seem to take the top off it, you know.</p>
        <h5>PITTI.</h5>  
        <p>I don't know about that.  It all depends!
        PEEP.  At all events, he will find it a drawback.</p>
        <h5>PITTI.</h5> 
        <p>Not necessarily.  Bless you, it all depends!</p>
        <h5>YUM.</h5>  
        <p><p>(in tears).</p>  I think it very indelicate of you to
        refer to such a subject on such a day.  If my married happiness
        is to be—to be—</p>
        <h5>PEEP.</h5>
        <p>Cut short.</p>
        <h5>YUM.</h5>
        <p>Well, cut short—in a month, can't you let me forget
        it?  <p>(Weeping.)</p></p>
        <h5>NANK.</h5>
        <p>Yum-Yum in tears—and on her wedding morn!
        YUM.  <p>(sobbing).</p>  They've been reminding me that in a month
        you're to be beheaded!  <p>(Bursts into tears.)</p></p>
        <h5>PITTI.</h5>
        <p>Yes, we've been reminding her that you're to be
        beheaded.  <p>(Bursts into tears.)</p></p>
        <h5>PEEP.</h5>
        <p>It's quite true, you know, you are to be beheaded!
        <p>(Bursts into tears.)</p></p>
        <h5>NANK.</h5>
        <p><p>(aside).</p>  Humph!  Now, some bridegrooms would be
        depressed by this sort of thing!  <p>(Aloud.)</p>  A month?  Well,
        what's a month?  Bah!  These divisions of time are purely
        arbitrary.  Who says twenty-four hours make a day?</p>
        <h5>PITTI.</h5>
        <p>There's a popular impression to that effect.</p>
        <h5>NANK.</h5>
        <p>Then we'll efface it.  We'll call each second a
        minute—each minute an hour—each hour a day—and each day a
        year.  At that rate we've about thirty years of married happiness
        before us!</p>
        

    <h5>SOLO—PITTI-SING.</h5>
    <p>
                 Sit with downcast eye
                      Let it brim with dew—
                 Try if you can cry—
                      We will do so, too.
                 When you're summoned, start
                      Like a frightened roe—
                 Flutter, little heart,
                      Colour, come and go!
                 Modesty at marriage-tide
                 Well becomes a pretty bride!
    </p>
